# ATS Platform Documentation

> **Embedded Firmware Automation Test System (ATS)**

This repository documents a production-style Embedded Firmware Automation Test System (ATS) designed to integrate directly with a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline and validate firmware on real hardware.

The system targets embedded and IoT teams who struggle with manual hardware testing, firmware regressions, and unsafe OTA releases, by introducing hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing that is automatically triggered on every firmware change.

This project is intentionally structured as a real internal platform, not a demo toy.

## 🎯 Why This System Exists

Firmware teams often rely on CI pipelines that stop at build or unit tests, while real hardware validation remains manual, slow, and error-prone. This gap allows firmware regressions, unsafe OTA updates, and hardware-related bugs to escape into the field.

**This ATS is designed to close that gap by bringing real hardware testing directly into the CI/CD workflow.**

---

## 1. What Problem Does This System Solve?

### Current Challenges

In many embedded and IoT product teams:

- CI pipelines stop at build or unit tests
- Firmware validation on real devices is manual and slow
- Hardware-dependent bugs are discovered late
- OTA updates are risky and hard to reproduce
- QA effort does not scale with firmware development speed

### Consequences

- Regressions reach field devices
- Release confidence is low
- Debugging hardware issues is expensive

### Solution

This ATS addresses those pain points by:

- Automatically flashing firmware to real ESP32 hardware
- Running power, IO, connectivity, and OTA tests
- Auditing results via UART, GPIO, and visual inspection
- Feeding results back into CI and observability systems

---

## 2. High-Level System Architecture

The ATS is split into three clearly separated planes:

### Control & Build Plane (Xeon Server)

- **Jenkins Master** (pipeline orchestration)
- **Jenkins Build Agents** (firmware build & artifact release)
- **Centralized metrics collection** (Prometheus)
- **Visualization** (Grafana)

### Execution Plane (ATS Nodes)

- **Raspberry Pi / Mini PC**
- **Jenkins ATS Agent**
- **Direct access to hardware:**
  - UART
  - GPIO
  - Relay / power control
  - Camera

### Device Under Test (DUT)

- **ESP32** running test firmware
- **GPIO outputs / inputs**
- **I2C OLED display**

### Benefits of This Separation

- CI orchestration is stable
- Hardware access is isolated
- The system can scale to multiple ATS nodes

---

## 3. CI Flow: Commit → Build → Test → Report

The end-to-end workflow is intentionally Jenkins-native:

1. **A developer creates a commit or PR in GitHub**
2. **GitHub triggers Jenkins via webhook**
3. **Jenkins Build Node (Xeon):**
   - Builds ESP32 firmware
   - Produces a versioned firmware artifact
4. **Jenkins dispatches the artifact to an ATS Node**
5. **ATS Node executes:**
   - Firmware flashing
   - Power/reset control
   - UART log capture
   - GPIO and OLED validation
   - Optional visual audit via camera + AI
6. **Test results and logs are:**
   - Reported back to Jenkins
   - Exposed as metrics to Prometheus
7. **Grafana dashboards provide:**
   - Regression trends
   - Pass/fail history
   - Firmware version correlation

**All steps run without manual intervention.**

---

## 4. Role of Each Node

### Jenkins Master (Xeon)

- Pipeline orchestration only
- No hardware access
- Schedules jobs across build and ATS agents

### Jenkins Build Node (Xeon)

- Builds firmware and images
- Produces artifacts
- Does not run hardware tests

### ATS Node (Raspberry Pi / Mini PC)

- Dedicated hardware test executor
- Flashing firmware to ESP32
- Power cycling and fault injection
- UART/GPIO inspection
- Camera capture and visual validation
- Exposes test metrics via HTTP for Prometheus

### ESP32 (DUT)

- Runs test firmware
- Exposes observable behavior:
  - GPIO state
  - OLED output
  - Boot logs
  - OTA behavior

---

## 5. Observability and Auditability

The ATS is designed to be observable by default.

### Metrics (Prometheus)

Examples:

- Firmware test duration
- Pass/fail counts
- OTA failure rate
- Reboot and crash counts
- Firmware version under test

### Visualization (Grafana)

- Firmware regression trends
- Stability over time
- Confidence before release

**This enables objective, data-driven release decisions, not gut feeling.**

---

## 6. Multi-ATS Scalability

The architecture supports horizontal scaling by design.

- Each ATS node is a self-contained test cell
- Jenkins schedules jobs using agent labels
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from all ATS nodes

**Adding capacity means:**

- Plug in another Pi / Mini PC
- Register a new Jenkins agent
- No pipeline changes required

This model naturally evolves into a hardware test farm.

## 7. Repository Structure

This project is intentionally split into multiple repositories:

### 📚 ats-platform-docs (this repo)

System overview, architecture, and roadmap

### 🔧 ats-fw-esp32-demo

ESP32 firmware designed for automated testing

**Firmware artifacts produced by this repository are validated using `ats-test-esp32-demo`.**

### 🧪 ats-test-esp32-demo

Hardware test execution framework for ESP32

### 🏗️ ats-ats-node

ATS agent scripts for flashing, testing, audit, and metrics

### 🚀 ats-ci-infra

Jenkins, Prometheus, and Grafana infrastructure (Docker-based)

**Test pipelines consume artifacts and invoke `ats-test-esp32-demo` on ATS nodes.**

---

Each repository has a single, well-defined responsibility.

## 8. Project Status & Intent

This system is:

- A reference architecture
- A foundation for real product adaptation
- Designed to mirror real embedded teams' workflows

It is **not** a generic testing framework or a UI-driven product.

### The intent is to demonstrate:

- Embedded systems expertise
- Hardware-aware CI/CD design
- Test automation ownership
- Production-grade thinking
